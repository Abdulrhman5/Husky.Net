## Credits

- This tool inspired of [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) & [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and a few other tools, for **DotNet**, so make sure to support them too!

- I'd also like to thank [kaylumah](https://github.com/kaylumah) for his [article](https://kaylumah.nl/2019/09/07/using-csharp-code-your-git-hooks.html) that gave me the csharp scripting support idea.
