## Introduction

Husky improves your commits and more üê∂ woof!

Run linters against staged git files and don't let üí© slip into your code base!

These two quotes from [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) JS tools inspired me to create Husky.Net for dotnet developers. it provides a simple and native way to do both also has a lot of other cool features. You can use it to lint your commit messages, run tests, lint code, etc. when you commit or push. üöÄüöÄ

## Features

- Supports all Git hooks
- Powered by modern new Git feature (core.hooksPath)
- User-friendly messages
- Supports macOS, Linux and Windows
- Git GUIs
- Custom directories
- Monorepo
- üî• Internal task runner!
- üî• Multiple file states (staged, last-commit, git-files, etc...)
- üî• Compatible with [dotnet-format](https://github.com/dotnet/format)
- üî• User-define arg variables
- üî• CSharp scripts (csx)
- üî• Supports gitflow hooks

## Why use Hooks and Husky.Net?

We, as developers, love platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Atlassian, Azure DevOps etc., as our managed git system and collaboration platform. We also love clean code and keep inventing new linters and rules to enforce it. In my opinion, every commit should allow the codebase to deploy to production. There is nothing worse than commits like ‚Äúfixed style errors‚Äù or ‚Äúfixed build‚Äù. These are often small mistakes you want to know as early as possible in your development cycle. You don‚Äôt want to break the build for the next developer because he pulled your ‚Äòmistake‚Äô or waste precious build minutes of your CI server. Say you have asked your teammate to review your code; in the meantime, the build server rejects your code. That means you have to go back and fix this, and your teammate has to come back and possibly review again after the changes (i.e., approvals reset on new commit). Doing so would waste a lot of time and effort. Husky.Net offers a very simple way to start using git hooks or running certain tasks, write custom scripts using c# and more ...

### A lot of features are coming soon, stay tuned! üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏èüëÄ

## Installation

```shell
# local installation (recommended)
cd <Your project root directory>
dotnet new tool-manifest
dotnet tool install Husky

# global installation
dotnet tool install --global Husky

```

_**Note**: With the global installation, you don't need to add the `dotnet` prefix to the commands._

### Setup husky for your project

```shell
cd <Your project root directory>
dotnet husky install
```

### Add your first hook

```shell
dotnet husky add pre-commit -c "echo 'Husky is awesome!'"
git add .husky/pre-commit
```

### Make a commit

```shell
git commit -m "Keep calm and commit"
# `echo 'Husky is awesome!'` will run every time you commit
```

## Automate husky installation for other contributors

If you installed husky locally, just add the below code to **one** of your projects (*.csproj *.vbproj).

**Important:** Just make sure to update the **working directory** depending on your folder structure.

```xml
<Target Name="husky" BeforeTargets="Restore;CollectPackageReferences" Condition="'$(HUSKY)' != 0">
   <Exec Command="dotnet tool restore"  StandardOutputImportance="Low" StandardErrorImportance="High"/>
   <Exec Command="dotnet husky install" StandardOutputImportance="Low" StandardErrorImportance="High"
         WorkingDirectory="../../" />  <!--Update this to the relative path to your project root dir -->
</Target>
```

### Disable husky in CI/CD pipelines
You can set the `HUSKY` environment variable to `0` to disable husky in CI/CD pipelines.

### Multiple target projects
If you have only one multiple target project (`TargetFrameworks`) use `IsCrossTargetingBuild` to the target tag to prevent multiple execution

```xml
<Target Name="husky" BeforeTargets="Restore;CollectPackageReferences" Condition="'$(HUSKY)' != 0 and '$(IsCrossTargetingBuild)' == 'true'">
   ...
```

### Using npm

If you are using the `npm`, add the below code to your `package.json` file to automatically install husky after the installation process:

```json
 "scripts": {
    "prepare": "dotnet tool restore && dotnet husky install"
 }
```

## Task runner

Linting makes more sense when run before committing your code. By doing so you can ensure no errors go into the repository and enforce code style. But running a lint process on a whole project is slow, and linting results can be irrelevant. Ultimately you only want to lint files that will be committed.

After installation, you must have `task-runner.json` file in your `.husky` directory that you can use to define your tasks.

you can run and test your tasks with `husky run` command. Once you are sure that your tasks are working properly, you can add it to the hook.

e.g.

```shell
dotnet husky add pre-commit -c "dotnet husky run"
```

### Task configurations

Each task in task-runner.json is a JSON object with the following properties:

---

| name     | optional | type                     | default                | description                                                            |
|----------|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| command  | false    | string                   | -                      | path to the executable file or script or executable name               |
| args     | true     | [string array]           | -                      | command arguments                                                      |
| include  | true     | [array of glob]          | `**/*`                 | glob pattern to select files                                           |
| name     | true     | string                   | command                | name of the task (recommended)                                         |
| group    | true     | string                   | -                      | group of the task (usually it should be the hook name)                 |
| branch   | true     | string (regex)           | -                      | run task on specific branches only                                     |
| pathMode | true     | [absolute, relative]     | relative               | file path style (relative or absolute)                                 |
| cwd      | true     | string                   | project root directory | current working directory for the command, can be relative or absolute |
| output   | true     | [always, verbose, never] | always                 | output log level                                                       |
| exclude  | true     | [array of glob]          | -                      | glob pattern to exclude files                                          |
| windows  | true     | object                   | -                      | overrides all the above settings for windows                           |

## Glob patterns

Husky.Net supports the standard dotnet `FileSystemGlobbing` patterns for include or exclude task configurations. read more [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/file-globbing#pattern-formats)

---

## Arg Variables

There are some variables that you can use in your task arguments.

- **${staged}**
  - returns the list of currently staged files
- **${last-commit}**
  - returns last commit changed files
- **${git-files}**
  - returns the output of (git ls-files)
- **${all-files}**
  - returns the list of matched files using include/exclude, be careful with this variable, it will return all the files if you don't specify include or exclude
- **${args}**
  - returns the arguments passed directly to the `husky run` command using `--args` option

e.g.`"args": [ "${staged}" ]`

### user-defined variables

You can define your own variables by adding a task to the `variables` section in `task-runner.json`.

e.g: defining custom `${root-dir}` variable to access root directory files

```json
{
   "variables": [
      {
         "name": "root-dir",
         "command": "cmd",
         "args": ["/c", "dir", "/b"]
      }
   ],
   "tasks": [
      {
         "command": "cmd",
         "args": ["/c", "echo", "${root-dir}"]
      }
   ]
}
```

---

## Using C# code in your git hooks

You can use the `exec` command to execute a C# script.

e.g.

```shell
dotnet husky exec <csx-file-path>
# e.g
# dotnet husky exec .husky/csx/hello.csx
```

Also, you can use your csx scripts in your tasks.

e.g task

```json
{
   "command": "dotnet",
   "args": [ "husky", "exec", ".husky/csx/hello.csx"  ],
}

```

This repo also using a csharp script to lint the commit messages, you can check it here ( [commit-lint.csx](.husky/csx/commit-lint.csx) / [commit-msg hook](.husky/commit-msg) / [task-runner.json](.husky/task-runner.json) )
